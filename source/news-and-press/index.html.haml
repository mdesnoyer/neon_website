              A unicorn appeared at a Silicon Valley event Wednesday night — in a screen print by the British artist Mark Wallinger. Unicorns of the tech type – startups with a valuation over $1 billion – also were discussed at a cocktail party on the top floor of the Epiphany Hotel in Palo Alto. There, William O’Reilly, of the art-auction house Bonhams, and Jon Callaghan, a founding partner of venture-capital firm True Ventures, drew parallels between venture capital and art investing. Both markets, for example, drew about $50 billion in investments last year, they said.

              More than 1.8 billion pictures are uploaded to the Internet every day—and Sophie Lebrecht knows exactly which ones you’ll choose to look at. Her company, Neon Labs, uses an algorithm to help a brand (or blog or game) select the single image from a video campaign that’s likeliest to be shared. Each of Neon’s customers has seen a 10% to 30% increase in engagement, she reports, and in just over two years, Lebrecht has served up more than a billion images. "Between Instagram, Snapchat, and TV, content creation grows and grows," she says.

It’s dominated by the device makers that let us easily load images to the Internet, as well as the social platforms that host video, like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.

              For the last several years, conventional wisdom has been that enterprise software is the exciting area in which venture capitalists should invest. A large number of celebrated exits have occurred with firms such as Workday, Tableau, and Splunk, all of which appear to have long runways ahead. But what is driving this switch to the popularity of new enterprise software? Is it simply due to cloud infrastructure enabling less expensive solutions than older on-premise deployments? Is it because a company can get traction with very little capital to figure out product/market fit?

              How does the brain connect what we see in the world with how we behave? This question launched my project to use the scientific understanding of human perception to better understand why the thumbnail images that preview online videos have so much influence over the number of clicks or views the video receives. I am a cognitive neuroscientist, working with a small group of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. Our goal is to understand how the brain’s visual system relates to people's slight positive or negative reactions to ordinary objects, which we call micro-valences.
